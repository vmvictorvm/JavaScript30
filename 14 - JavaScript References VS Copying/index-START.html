    let age2 = age;

     console.log(`age: ${age} ---  age2: ${age2}`);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

   console.log(`players: ${players} ---  team: ${team}`)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
//     team[3] = 'Lux';
// console.log(`players: ${players} ---  team: ${team}`)
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //Ans: Both array changed cuz they are referencing the same array.

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead! (4 ways to copy an array!)
    const team2 = players.slice();  //slice() without args return a copy of the array.
    const team3 = [].concat(players); //alternative way to copy an array.
    const team4 = [...players];  //using spread operator ES6 way to copy array.
    const team5 = Array.from(players);  //Another method to copy array

    team2[3] = 'lux';
console.log(`players: ${players} ---  team2: ${team2}`)
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Victor M',
      age: 80
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
        // const captain = person;
        // captain.number = 99;
        // console.log(person);
        // console.log(captain);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });  //arg1: {} empty object, arg2: object you want to copy into, arg3: additional property/data you want to include in the new object.
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
   // const cap3 = {...person};



    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.


    const vic = {
      name: 'Vic',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@vmvictor',
        facebook: 'vm.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    //console.log(vic);

    //Object.assign only work for 1 level deep!!!!
    const dev = Object.assign({}, vic);  
    dev.name = 'victor';
        console.log(dev);
    console.log(vic);
    dev.social.twitter = '@anotherguy';
    console.log(dev);
    console.log(vic);


    //Solution (lodash cloneDeep method)

    //Alternative Solution (cheap/performance issue)
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(vic));
